# Poet Entrepreneur

<img style="width: 90%; height: auto;" src="./poet-entrepreneur-bbb.png" alt="Cover Image" title="Cover Image" />

A few months ago, I was accepted into the training programme at the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology. Here is a collection of poetry detailing my first few days at MEST, our first challenge before classes officially resume, and my experience during my first few days in Accra, Ghana.

## Recruitment

### Moments of anxiety

every bit of information  
was a drop of wise wine  
to my thirsty soul  
for I was the newest son of Tantalus  
eager to learn  
eager to earn  
eager to give

but what service can,  
a youthful merchant proffer  
at the base  
of a global altar

innovation or creation  
never competition,  
and even when the last  
is truly needed,  
how might it be done  
without quiet reflection

### Helpful siren call

straight out of university  
seeking out my destiny  
I see a precious opportunity  
I pause then pounce  
I am knocked back by reality

then I learn better  
push further  
and the whisper of melting water  
lets me know  
I can be tutored in the art  
of pristine excellence

a school of business  
in the truest sense  
and I am captivated  
but in no fatal sense  
simply, in one of growth  
and I heed the  
helpful siren call

### When it all began

I stood far away  
close, yet still distant  
unsure of what still might  
be untoward or pleasant

I dreamt of wins  
and dreaded losses  
I sought nothing  
but growth and fortune

such was my soul  
as I arrived  
at the land of dreams  
at the edge of delight

### Tower of hope

white walls  
and steep slopes  
best describe  
my humble home

a collection of flats  
in stacks of three  
with folds of rooms  
that hold simple souls,  
more complex  
in their mundanity  
even than the greatest sea  
or the briefest cliff

### Monday the first

a week before learning  
I was busy studying  
perspectives and realities  
in abundance about me

from the French of the west  
to the Swahili of the east  
from the tune, I always sought  
to the song I grew up singing

I took a break  
from technicality  
and pursued practicality  
blessing all those  
who would have me  
and growing through  
those who were kind  
enough to teach me

### Happy meals

full nutrition  
and proper sustenance  
kiss my stoic belly  
and hug my sombre mind

I strive to learn  
the names of all who  
in their official capacity  
tend and care  
to my apt feeding

there is Linda, who I met first  
then Diane with a regal smile  
and Aunt Mary, as she prefers to be called  
Amelia, and Beatrice  
whose names I oft mixup  
not for a reason mischievious  
but for the short space of time  
with which I have worked with

## First challenge / Experiences

### Buy, bet & barter

one, two, three,  
twenty cedis  
as an investment to double  
and triple

to over-multiply  
and flip a proper profit  
to actively acquire the cold  
technical skills  
that prove necessary  
for the survival of  
every Entrepreneurial entreprise

we plotted and schemed  
for good, and no evil  
to prove our business strength  
profit being no metric for success  
embracing ethics  
and deciding our worth

### Chale Wote

friend, have you heard  
a tale of love and war  
a story of excitement  
an avenue of warmth

> a party by the ocean

a place of true emotion  
a path of human traffic  
of peculiar experiences  
of culture and determination  
of grim expectation

> a party by the ocean

### Music unheard

I used to rap and sing  
and did so yesterday  
the second to the last  
of a strong length of days  
of active recreation

when I heard a beat  
loud enough  
for none to hear me spit  
I whispered aloud  
emotions spectacular

happy I had made it this far  
excited just by life  
and triggered by the sights  
the smells and motion  
of a thousand  
subtle dreams

### Storming

my team was  
at first, for a moment  
pirates on the open sea

with a queen from the south  
advising wisdom

and I, a renegade poet  
proffering solutions  
digital and artistic

with a soldier from the west  
my very own country  
depicting tales of strength  
I did not at first understand

and a capable guide from the nation  
we will have for a home  
for a year, and many a happy day

my team, eventually found  
they each had unique skills  
we turned the storm  
into a mirror  
and by swift reflection  
found our sure path to the shore

### A war of roses

face painting and poetry  
delivery joy, and history  
no measure when we pour  
our shots of wonder

teamwork  
and subtle perspiration  
new tastes  
and soft delusion

we build on love  
and go to war on hate  
we haggle with the lords of fate  
our customers  
come from heaven's gate

### Tradition

jungle dancing  
and sweet romancing  
of thoughts and ideas  
of things once feared  
of lyrics unsung  
and party garments unhung

### What

is the real reason  
why we dance on clouds so high  
and seek, want to fly

are the wonders of  
galaxies, under the sea  
Atlantis, and such

do we mean, when we  
I love you, understand  
are these just empty  
... things

### Premium premium

no price for  
Freudian contemplations  
and half-spoken thoughts

no cost for  
such decisions  
as betting on faulty pleasures

no truth  
in crippled words  
half-thrust without intention

premium  
is the measure of honesty  
premium  
is intuition  
premium  
is self-awareness

### Why art is hard

I saw some on sale  
I put out some pale  
some filled with colour  
truth, and humour

all for the sake  
of self-inquiry  
for you see my diary  
exists in bits and pieces  
I found this in truth  
in the poems, I learnt to forget

### Palmwine fuel

I sipped yesterday  
on the essence of  
an ancient liquor  
nothing concentrated  
all parts joy

infused too with herb  
the colour of burnt sugar  
but far from caramel

it made me motivated  
and tickled me to action  
I would have worked regardless  
but wisdom sits  
at its junction

### Pesewas

true profit  
has odd earnings  
as part of the deal  
the complete win

in the coffers of those  
who farm with capital  
it is rare,  
that a round figure  
rings the bell  
once one does sell

---

## Moving forward

### Clockwork

time is the river  
upon which life learns to swim  
float or sink  
either way, the currents sing  
either way the constant wins

so I will make  
the best of mine  
and aid those oar  
who float afar

This is the most honest reflection of my time spent in Accra at this moment. I write as I feel, with no reservations. I am poetry - we all are in truth. Hopefully, the art that is our soul will suffice for our joy.
