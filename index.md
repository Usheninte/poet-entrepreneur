# Poet Entrepreneur

<img style="width: 90%; height: auto;" src="./poet-entrepreneur-bbb.png" alt="Cover Image" title="Cover Image" />

A few months ago, I was accepted into the training programme at the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology. Here is a collection of poetry detailing my first few days at MEST, our first challenge before classes officially resume, and my experience during my first few days in Accra, Ghana.

## Recruitment

### Moments of anxiety

every bit of information  
was a drop of wise wine  
to my thirsty soul  
for I was the newest son of Tantalus  
eager to learn  
eager to earn  
eager to give

but what service can,  
a youthful merchant proffer  
at the base  
of a global altar

innovation or creation  
never competition,  
and even when the last  
is truly needed,  
how might it be done  
without quiet reflection

### Helpful siren call

straight out of university  
seeking out my destiny  
I see a precious opportunity  
I pause then pounce  
I am knocked back by reality

then I learn better  
push further  
and the whisper of melting water  
lets me know  
I can be tutored in the art  
of pristine excellence

a school of business  
in the truest sense  
and I am captivated  
but in no fatal sense  
simply, in one of growth  
and I heed the  
helpful siren call

### When it all began

I stood far away  
close, yet still distant  
unsure of what still might  
be untoward or pleasant

I dreamt of wins  
and dreaded losses  
I sought nothing  
but growth and fortune

such was my soul  
as I arrived  
at the land of dreams  
at the edge of delight

### Tower of hope

white walls  
and steep slopes  
best describe  
my humble home

a collection of flats  
in stacks of three  
with folds of rooms  
that hold simple souls,  
more complex  
in their mundanity  
even than the greatest sea  
or the briefest cliff

### Monday the first

a week before learning  
I was busy studying  
perspectives and realities  
in abundance about me

from the French of the west  
to the Swahili of the east  
from the tune, I always sought  
to the song I grew up singing

I took a break  
from technicality  
and pursued practicality  
blessing all those  
who would have me  
and growing through  
those who were kind  
enough to teach me

### Happy meals

full nutrition  
and proper sustenance  
kiss my stoic belly  
and hug my sombre mind

I strive to learn  
the names of all who  
in their official capacity  
tend and care  
to my apt feeding

there is Linda, who I met first  
then Diane with a regal smile  
and Aunt Mary, as she prefers to be called  
Amelia, and Beatrice  
whose names I oft mixup  
not for a reason mischievious  
but for the short space of time  
with which I have worked with

## First challenge / Experiences

### Buy, bet & barter

one, two, three,
twenty cedis
as an investment to double
and triple

to over-multiply
and flip a proper profit
to actively acquire the cold
technical skills
that prove necessary
for the survival of
every Entrepreneurial entreprise

we plotted and schemed
for good, and no evil
to prove our business strength
profit being no metric for success
embracing ethics
and deciding our worth

### Chale Wote

friend, have you heard
a tale of love and war
a story of excitement
an avenue of warmth

> a party by the ocean

a place of true emotion
a path of human traffic
of peculiar experiences
of culture and determination
of grim expectation

> a party by the ocean

### Music unheard

I used to rap and sing
and did so yesterday
the second to the last
of a strong length of days
of active recreation

when I heard a beat
loud enough
for none to hear me spit
I whispered aloud
emotions spectacular

happy I had made it this far
excited just by life
and triggered by the sights
the smells and motion
of a thousand
subtle dreams

### Storming

my team was
at first, for a moment
pirates on the open sea

with a queen from the south
advising wisdom

and I, a renegade poet
proffering solutions
digital and artistic

with a soldier from the west
my very own country
depicting tales of strength
I did not at first understand

and a capable guide from the nation
we will have for a home
for a year, and many a happy day

my team, eventually found
they each had unique skills
we turned the storm
into a mirror
and by swift reflection
found our sure path to the shore

### A war of roses

face painting and poetry
delivery joy, and history
no measure when we pour
our shots of wonder

teamwork
and subtle perspiration
new tastes
and soft delusion

we build on love
and go to war on hate
we haggle with the lords of fate
our customers
come from heaven's gate

### Tradition

jungle dancing
and sweet romancing
of thoughts and ideas
of things once feared
of lyrics unsung
and party garments unhung

### What

is the real reason
why we dance on clouds so high
and seek, want to fly

are the wonders of
galaxies, under the sea
Atlantis, and such

do we mean, when we
I love you, understand
are these just empty
... things

### Premium premium

no price for
Freudian contemplations
and half-spoken thoughts

no cost for
such decisions
as betting on faulty pleasures

no truth
in crippled words
half-thrust without intention

premium
is the measure of honesty
premium
is intuition
premium
is self-awareness

### Why art is hard

I saw some on sale
I put out some pale
some filled with colour
truth, and humour

all for the sake
of self-inquiry
for you see my diary
exists in bits and pieces
I found this in truth
in the poems, I learnt to forget

### Palmwine fuel

I sipped yesterday
on the essence of
an ancient liquor
nothing concentrated
all parts joy

infused too with herb
the colour of burnt sugar
but far from caramel

it made me motivated
and tickled me to action
I would have worked regardless
but wisdom sits
at its junction

### Pesewas

true profit
has odd earnings
as part of the deal
the complete win

in the coffers of those
who farm with capital
it is rare,
that a round figure
rings the bell
once one does sell

---

## Moving forward

### Clockwork

time is the river
upon which life learns to swim
float or sink
either way, the currents sing
either way the constant wins

so I will make
the best of mine
and aid those oar
who float afar

This is the most honest reflection of my time spent in Accra at this moment. I write as I feel, with no reservations. I am poetry - we all are in truth. Hopefully, the art that is our soul will suffice for our joy.
